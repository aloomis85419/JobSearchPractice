1. Create generic list node object with next node and value
2. The newhead 0f the list will be set to null. Set the heads next node to be equal to the node passed in.
3. The current node will be equal to the node passed in.
4. The previous node will be equal to the new head.
5. each iteration:
    if the value of the current node is = to k set previous.next = current.next and set the value of current to be current.next
    else set the previous = current (advances one position) and current = current.next
